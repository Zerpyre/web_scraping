16c. Key literature references and sources for data
Sources for data
Primary data for the calculation of the hazards has preferentially been taken from the official European classification list,
1272/2008 Annex I , as updated to 2015-06-05.
Where such data was lacking, on the second hand the documentation on which this official classification is based was used, e.g.
IUCLID (International Uniform Chemical Information Database). On the third hand, information was used from reputable
international chemical suppliers, and on the fourth hand from other available information, e.g. safety data sheets from other
suppliers or information from non-profit associations, whereby the reliability of the source was judged by an expert. If, in spite of
this, reliable information was not found, the hazards were judged by expert opinions based on the known properties of similar
substances, and according to the principles in 1907/2006 and 1272/2008.
